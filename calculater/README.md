# Basic Calculator

A premium, modern Basic Calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates core front-end development skills including semantic HTML, CSS3 styling (Glassmorphism), and DOM manipulation with JavaScript.

## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (÷), and Modulo (%).
- **Modern Design**: Features a beautiful "Glassmorphism" UI with vibrant background animations.
- **Responsiveness**: Fully responsive layout that adapts to mobile and desktop screens.
- **Keyboard Support**: fast input using your keyboard's numpad or number row.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles errors like Division by Zero.
- **Input Validation**: Prevents invalid inputs (e.g., multiple decimals).

## How to Use

1. **Open the Calculator**: Simply open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. **Perform Calculations**: Click buttons or use your keyboard to input numbers and operators.
3. **Get Results**: Press `=` or `Enter` to see the result.
4. **Clear/Delete**: Use `AC` (or `Escape`) to clear everything, and `DEL` (or `Backspace`) to remove the last digit.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structure.
- **CSS3**: For styling, animations, and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For logic and interactivity.
